Write a function which takes an input parameter as an array of integers and prints the sum of all non prime numbers from the given array. If all integers present in the input array are prime the program should print sum as 0.
Example:
Input1: [1, 14, 5, 7] Output: sum=15
Input2: [2, 10, 13, 9] Output: sum=19
